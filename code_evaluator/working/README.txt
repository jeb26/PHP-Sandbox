PHP Script that will evaluate an open-ended programming question

3 Parts to the script:

1. creating either a java file or python file on server for evaluation

2. compiling the file. if the file compiles correctly then output
that it compiled correctly. otherwise output the compile errors

3. run the test cases. test cases will be passed as cli line paramters. the output of compiltion must be grabbed then checked against the correct answer which comes from the test case.
